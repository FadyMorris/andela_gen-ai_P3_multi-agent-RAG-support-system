# Company HR Policies and Procedures Manual

## 1. Welcome and Introduction

Welcome to our organization! This comprehensive Human Resources manual serves as your guide to understanding our company policies, procedures, benefits, and workplace culture. We are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and productive work environment where every employee can thrive and contribute to our collective success.

## 2. Company Mission and Values

Our mission is to deliver exceptional service while fostering innovation and maintaining the highest ethical standards. Our core values include integrity, collaboration, accountability, innovation, and respect for diversity. Every employee is expected to embody these values in their daily work and interactions with colleagues, customers, and stakeholders.

## 3. Equal Employment Opportunity Policy

We are an Equal Opportunity Employer committed to workplace diversity. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristic. All employment decisions are made based on qualifications, merit, and business needs.

## 4. Employment Categories and Classifications

Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Exempt employees are salaried and not eligible for overtime pay. Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime compensation for hours worked beyond 40 in a workweek. Employment status may be full-time (40 hours/week), part-time (less than 40 hours/week), temporary, or contract-based.

## 5. Recruitment and Selection Process

Our recruitment process ensures fair and transparent hiring. Positions are posted internally and externally. The selection process typically includes application review, phone screening, skills assessment, panel interviews, reference checks, and background verification. We aim to complete the hiring process within 4-6 weeks of posting.

## 6. New Employee Onboarding

New hires participate in a comprehensive onboarding program lasting 90 days. The first week includes orientation sessions covering company history, culture, policies, benefits enrollment, IT setup, and departmental introductions. Each new employee is assigned a mentor to facilitate integration and answer questions during the probationary period.

## 7. Probationary Period Policy

All new employees serve a 90-day probationary period during which performance is closely monitored. During this time, employment may be terminated by either party without notice. Probationary employees are eligible for most benefits but may have limited paid time off accrual. A formal evaluation occurs at the end of the probationary period.

## 8. Employee Personnel Files

We maintain confidential personnel files for each employee containing employment applications, job descriptions, performance evaluations, disciplinary records, training certificates, and compensation information. Employees may request to review their files with 48 hours notice. Access is restricted to authorized HR personnel and management on a need-to-know basis.

## 9. Work Schedule and Hours

Standard business hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, with a one-hour lunch break. Actual schedules vary by department and position. Non-exempt employees must accurately record all time worked using our timekeeping system. Supervisors approve schedules and any deviations must be pre-approved.

## 10. Attendance and Punctuality

Regular attendance and punctuality are essential. Employees must notify their supervisor at least one hour before their scheduled start time if unable to report to work. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action. Three unexcused absences within a 30-day period may lead to termination.

## 11. Remote Work and Telecommuting Policy

Eligible positions may participate in remote work arrangements with manager approval. Remote workers must maintain dedicated workspace, adhere to scheduled work hours, remain accessible during business hours, and maintain productivity standards. Equipment and internet connectivity requirements are specified in individual remote work agreements.

## 12. Flexible Work Arrangements

We support work-life balance through flexible arrangements including flextime, compressed workweeks, and job sharing where operationally feasible. Requests are evaluated based on job requirements, performance history, and business needs. Approved arrangements are documented and reviewed quarterly.

## 13. Compensation Philosophy

Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees. We conduct annual market surveys to ensure competitive pay. Compensation decisions consider job responsibilities, required skills, performance, internal equity, and market conditions. All compensation information is confidential.

## 14. Salary Administration

Salary ranges are established for each position based on market data and internal equity. New hire salaries are typically set within the lower half of the range based on qualifications. Salary increases are merit-based and occur during annual performance reviews. Promotions may result in salary adjustments based on the new position's range.

## 15. Payroll Procedures

Employees are paid bi-weekly via direct deposit. Pay periods run from Sunday through the second following Saturday with payday on the Friday after period close. Pay stubs are accessible through our HR portal. Questions regarding payroll should be directed to the Payroll Department within 5 business days of payday.

## 16. Overtime Compensation

Non-exempt employees receive overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Overtime must be pre-approved by supervisors. Unauthorized overtime may result in disciplinary action. Comp time is not permitted as an alternative to overtime pay for non-exempt employees.

## 17. Performance Management System

Our performance management process includes goal setting, continuous feedback, mid-year check-ins, and annual evaluations. Performance ratings range from Unsatisfactory to Exceptional. Evaluations assess competencies, goal achievement, and behavioral alignment with company values. Results inform development plans and compensation decisions.

## 18. Annual Performance Reviews

Formal performance reviews occur annually on the employee's anniversary date. Supervisors and employees complete self-assessments, meet to discuss performance, establish goals for the coming year, and identify development needs. Documentation is maintained in personnel files. Ratings directly impact merit increases and promotion eligibility.

## 19. Performance Improvement Plans

Employees not meeting performance expectations may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) outlining specific deficiencies, required improvements, timelines, and consequences of non-improvement. PIPs typically last 30-90 days with regular check-ins. Successful completion removes the PIP; failure may result in termination.

## 20. Professional Development and Training

We invest in employee growth through training programs, workshops, conferences, certifications, and tuition reimbursement. Employees may request training related to current roles or career development. Approval depends on budget availability and business relevance. Required training is company-paid and considered work time.

## 24. Transfer and Reassignment Policy
